Systems medicine is an interdisciplinary approach in which physicians and clinical researchers collaborate with experts from the fields of biology, biostatistics, informatics and mathematics to improve the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of diseases. For this, large-scale, heterogeneous data sets must be collected experimentally and merged using holistic models. In reality, however, most projects are still limited to individual cellular processes and develop customized models for these.
